						HTML headings are tags that are used to hold titles and subheadings
						on a web page. They range from H1, which holds the overall title of
						the page, to H2 - H6, which hold subheadings. The importance of the
						heading decreases as the number increases.
					</p>
					<p>
						A good way to think about headings is to imagine a table of
						contents. The headings make up the important parts of your content
						that you would want users to find quickly.

					<p>Headings are important for a number of reasons.</p>
					<ul className="list">
						<li>
							They give order and structure to the web page, making it easier
							for users to understand the layout and content of the page.
						</li>
						<li>
							They allow the browser to index and structure the page visually,
							which helps users find what they are looking for.
						</li>
						<li>
							They allow screen reader users to skip to specific sections of the
							page, so they can find the information they need quickly.

					title="What Should Be Included in a Heading?">
					<p>
						When using headings, it is important to include descriptive titles
						and subheadings that accurately describe the content on the page.
						This will help users to find what they are looking for more easily.
						Headings should also be concise and to the point. They should
						clearly summarize the content that follows.

					<p>
						Writing a good heading is all about being descriptive, and
						remembering how to nest heading sections within one another in
						sequential order.

					<ul className="list">
						<li>
							Avoid using more than one H1 on a page, as this can confuse the

							used for the most important topic on the page.
						</li>
						<li>
							Headings should not be chosen for style purposes - use CSS to
							style sections instead.
						</li>
						<li>
							Headings should not be placed in non sequential order to ensure
							that the structure of the page makes sense.
