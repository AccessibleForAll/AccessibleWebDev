# Accessible Web Dev
This site is intended to be a resource for developers wanting to learn the basics about accessibility in a clear and easy to understand way. It is not intended to replace official documentation and guidelines but to provide a stepping stone to get started where official documentation is often difficult to interpret for new web developers.
