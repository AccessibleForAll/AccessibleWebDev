Welcome to **Accessible Web Dev**, a resource designed to help web developers learn the fundamentals of accessibility in a practical, easy-to-understand way. This site is an **entry point** into the world of accessibility, complementing current standards by breaking down complex concepts. While it doesn't replace existing standards like the [WCAG standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), it offers a beginner-friendly pathway into accessibility for developers of all experience levels.
