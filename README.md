# Accessible Web Dev
This project is intended to be one of the many resources for developers who want to learn the basics about accessibility in a clear and easy way. It is not intended to replace the official documentation and guidelines but to provide that easy understanding of the official documentation when you are just getting started. This project profers solutions to the most parts where the official documentation is often difficult to interpret to new web developers or developers in general.
