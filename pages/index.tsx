					<h2>Welcome!</h2>
					<p>
						Accessible web dev is here to make accessibility more understandable
						for developers and designers as current standards can be hard to
						understand.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is not a replacement for current standards but hopefully a
						complement to them and help on your journey to creating more
						accessible web experiences for everyone.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each page will contain a variety of examples of how to make specific
						elements or widgets accessible. It will also provide links to
						resources and further reading.
					</p>
					{/* <p>
						It is currently a work in progress so not all pages are finished (or
						even started). If you don't find what you are looking for please
						feel free to{" "}
